        <h1>Care workers &amp; their duties</h1>
        <p>The main duties for care workers are conducting tasks in a professional manner, that may otherwise be carried out by a close friend or relative, using their training and knowledge to ensure a safe care service.</p>
        <p>Our care workers have to understand the needs of our clients to successfully deliver care. This includes communicating successfully with the office, family, friends and other healthcare professionals. Where necessary, the care worker has a duty to inform the on call supervisor/office of any changes or causes of concern with regard to a client's health and condition.</p>
        <p>All tasks required for a client will be listed in a Care Plan to be followed by the care worker in accordance with our policies and procedures.</p>

        <p>The role of the care worker demands a great deal both physically and emotionally and carries a large amount of responsibility, with a primary concern for the welfare of others.</p>
